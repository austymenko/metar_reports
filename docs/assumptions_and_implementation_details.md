## Application of SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

This METAR Reports Processor application demonstrates the use of several SOLID principles and design patterns, showcasing best practices in software development:

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
    - Each class (e.g., MetarParserService, MetarReportRepository) has a single, well-defined responsibility.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
    - The application is designed to be easily extendable without modifying existing code.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
    - High-level modules (e.g., MetarStreamService) depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

### Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**:
    - MetarReportRepository encapsulates the logic for storing and retrieving METAR data.

- **Service Layer Pattern**:
    - MetarParserService and MetarStreamService provide a clear API for business logic.

- **Command Pattern**:
    - ParseWindCommand encapsulates the algorithm for parsing wind information.

- **Dependency Injection**:
    - Dependencies are injected into classes, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

### Other Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns**:
    - Clear separation between parsing, data storage, and stream processing logic.

- **Immutability**:
    - Use of frozen string literals to prevent unintended string modifications.

- **Error Handling**:
    - Custom error classes for different types of parsing errors.

- **Code Organization**:
    - Logical grouping of related functionality into separate classes and modules.

These principles and patterns contribute to a maintainable, extensible, and robust application architecture.
